title: External Link Behavior
---

External links in documentation should open in new tabs to preserve user context, especially when users are mid-procedure or referencing supplementary information.

## Opening in New Tabs

The [W3C recommends](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G200) opening new windows/tabs only when necessary. For documentation sites, this is the exception: users frequently navigate away mid-task to check a UI, read detailed specs, or explore related concepts. Opening external links in new tabs prevents context loss and allows users to easily return to their place in the documentation.

Many users have developed the habit of Cmd/Ctrl+clicking links to open them in new tabs, recognizing the value of preserving their reading context.

## Visual Indicators

W3C guidelines recommend warning users when a link opens in a new window/tab. The external link icon serves this purpose and is widely recognized across documentation sites.

**When to use the icon:**
- Standard inline external links
- Links within body text or procedures

**When to skip the icon:**
- Cards or large clickable areas that function as links
- Lists of external resources where it's obvious all items are external
- Cases where repetitive icons create visual noise

Provide manual overrides in your link component to handle these exceptions while maintaining the icon as the default behavior.

## Example

The `Link` component from `@roadlittledawn/docs-design-system-react` automatically detects external links and adds the icon:

```jsx
import { Link } from '@roadlittledawn/docs-design-system-react';

// External link - opens in new tab with icon
<Link href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G200">
  W3C guidance on opening new windows
</Link>

// Internal link - no icon, same tab
<Link href="/principles/personalization">
  Personalization principles
</Link>
```
