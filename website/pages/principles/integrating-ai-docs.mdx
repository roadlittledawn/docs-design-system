title: Integrating AI into Documentation
---

AI tools help authors write quality documentation faster, especially non-writers and subject matter experts. However, it's easier than ever to generate _a lot_ of content that may not be accurate, complete, or relevant to your audience. As with code, working iteratively and giving the AI agent the right guidelines and examples is critical.

AI tools need high quality, authoritative content for product knowledge. Documentation is often the primary source of authoritative information for your customers, as well as any AI tools provided to those customers (chatbots, AI search, etc.). This means docs need to maintain their quality standards through adherence to style guides, rigorous review processes, and regular updates - especially when that content feeds AI systems.

There are three primary areas to integrate AI into documentation workflows:

- **Authoring**: Help writers and contributors create high quality docs faster
- **Reviewing**: Automate first-pass content review for quality and consistency
- **Discovery**: Help users find answers through AI-powered search and chat

## Authoring

AI can help bridge the gap between subject matter experts and your docs platform. Use cases include:

- **Format conversion**: Migrate content to your docs system's specific formatting (MDX, custom components, etc.)
- **Style guide enforcement**: Convert raw content to match your style guide automatically
- **Reducing friction for SMEs**: Enable contributors who don't have time to learn your docs system's particulars
- **First draft generation**: Create initial content from specs, code comments, or meeting notes

**Best practices:**
- Provide the AI with your style guide, component examples, and existing docs as context
- Use iterative prompting - don't expect perfect output on first try
- Always review AI-generated content for technical accuracy
- Consider setting up custom instructions or agents for common conversion tasks

## Reviewing

If your writing team accepts contributions from outside the team, AI can augment your review process:

- **Automated style checks**: First-pass review for style guide compliance, tone, and consistency
- **Technical accuracy flags**: Identify potential errors, outdated information, or incomplete explanations
- **Accessibility review**: Check for common accessibility issues (alt text, heading structure, etc.)
- **Suggested improvements**: Get recommendations for clarity, completeness, or better examples

**Best practices:**
- Use AI as a first pass, not a replacement for human review
- Train reviewers on how to use AI effectively in their workflow
- Consider integrating AI review as a GitHub Action or pre-commit hook
- Maintain human oversight for technical accuracy and product-specific nuance

## Discovery

Help users find information faster through AI-augmented interfaces:

- **AI chat interface**: Conversational search powered by your documentation content
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Index your docs in a vector database for context-aware answers
- **Semantic search**: Help users find relevant content even when they don't know the exact terms

**Implementation considerations:**
- Provide markdown exports or API endpoints for each docs page for indexing
- Consider S3 or similar storage for syncing content to AI backends
- Design for freshness - ensure your AI has access to the latest content
- Monitor quality - track when AI gives incorrect or incomplete answers

**Success metrics:**
- Track defect ratio (were users able to complete their task?) rather than just satisfaction scores
- Measure time to resolution
- Monitor which questions AI can't answer well - these indicate content gaps

## Advanced patterns

### Docs as end-to-end tests

Documentation can serve as executable specifications. An AI agent can:
1. Read your user guide or tutorial
2. Use a virtual browser or API client to follow the instructions
3. Attempt to complete the documented tasks
4. Report success/failure and where instructions break

This creates a feedback loop where outdated docs are automatically flagged when product changes break the documented workflows.

**Use cases:**
- UI documentation testing with browser automation
- API tutorial validation
- Installation guide verification

### AI-native docs platforms

Emerging platforms can source information from multiple systems (GitHub repos, Slack, wikis, etc.) and automatically generate or update documentation.

**Where this works well:**
- API documentation derived from code
- Single-tool reference docs with clear source material
- Changelog generation from commits

**Current limitations:**
- Cross-product documentation that spans multiple systems
- Conceptual content that requires synthesis across sources
- Docs requiring editorial judgment about what to include/exclude
- Content needing consistent narrative voice

**Recommendation:** Best used as a supplement to human-authored docs, not a complete replacement.
