# Content Quality & Success Metrics

Traditional content metrics are evolving as AI reshapes how users consume documentation. Success measurement requires new approaches that account for both human and AI-powered experiences.

## Rethinking CSAT & Helpfulness Scores

CSAT and helpfulness ratings are valuable as content freshness signals, but problematic as primary success metrics:

- **Low sample sizes** create unreliable data
- **Negativity bias** - dissatisfied users disproportionately respond
- **Context matters** - poor ratings may reflect external factors (product issues, user expectations) rather than content quality

**Better approach:** Use CSAT as a trigger for content review and updates, not as a standalone quality measure.

## AI-Era Quality Signals

### Defect Ratios in AI Applications

When docs power AI-driven support or code generation:

- Track **hallucination rates** and incorrect answers traced to documentation gaps
- Monitor **clarification requests** that indicate incomplete or ambiguous content
- Measure **correction frequency** when AI responses require human intervention

### Completeness Takes New Importance

In the AI context, documenting obvious details matters:

- AI systems need explicit, comprehensive information - they can't infer from context like humans
- Edge cases and basic information both contribute to AI knowledge graphs
- Gaps that humans navigate easily become blind spots for AI

## Metadata & Multi-Signal Approaches

AI systems need richer signals beyond content alone:

- **Freshness indicators** - last updated, version markers, deprecation flags
- **Engagement metrics** - usage patterns, time-on-page, bounce rates
- **Sentiment signals** - aggregated feedback across multiple touchpoints
- **Authority weighting** - source credibility, expertise markers, review status

### Example: Knowledge Base Filtering

Organizations applying simple filtering on large content repositories (e.g., 15M+ wiki pages) achieve measurable improvements:

- Filter by authoritativeness and recency
- Bias AI systems toward vetted, maintained content first
- Similar to page ranking in search algorithms - quality signals compound

## Measuring What Matters

Focus metrics on outcomes:

- **Task completion rates** - can users accomplish their goals?
- **Time to resolution** - how quickly do they find answers?
- **AI-assisted accuracy** - when AI uses your docs, what's the success rate?
- **Content utilization** - which docs actually get used (by humans and AI)?

Quality measurement is shifting from satisfaction scores to effectiveness signals across both human and AI consumption patterns.
